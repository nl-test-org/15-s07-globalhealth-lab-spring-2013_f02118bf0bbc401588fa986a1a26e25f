Before the onsite project, class usually meets twice a week in February and March, and students also attend a small number of lunch sessions and mentor meetings. In April, class meets once a week to allow time for mentor and team meetings. Class sessions include interactions with guests to build the dialog—not only within the class but also within the wider community.

The following table lists the session topics, and required preparation and follow-up for each session. This list of scheduled sessions does not include deliverables and course assignments, which are listed on the [Deliverables and Action Steps]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/deliverables-and-action-steps) page. During certain class sessions, in-class surveys are conducted as check-ins for assignments and deliverables progress, and are indicated in the table below. Full citations for the readings and cases are available on the [Readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) page.

\[S\] = Regular class session

\[LS\] = Lunch session with guest speakers. At least one, though preferably all team members, should attend. Any students who miss these sessions MUST obtain full debriefing from teammates and follow up as needed.

\[M\] = Meetings scheduled in place of class sessions.
