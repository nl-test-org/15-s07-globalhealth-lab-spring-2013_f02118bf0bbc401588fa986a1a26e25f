To support the projects, class sessions are designed to be interactive and connect to key issues for all projects. Every Wednesday, teams submit a WedUp—a simple, consistently formatted status update that enables project progress while documenting work steps to support learning. On Fridays, team assignments are due. Most are brief and all are designed to support project work. In April, students complete an assignment that distills their learning in the field to share lessons learned with others.

Below is a list of the major assignments, categorized by type, and their respective due dates. For a detailed breakdown of tasks and action items ordered chronologically, see the [Deliverables and Action Steps]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/deliverables-and-action-steps) page.

Host, course team, and teammates assessment of participation and contributions to meetings, formal sessions, informal work, and all other personal contributions modify overall course performance assessment and could result in a final grade difference. Class attendance is tracked.

Sloan Portfolio (20% of grade; SIP credit)
------------------------------------------

The [Sloan portfolio (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit15_s07s13_sloanportfol) is designed in part to meet the [MIT Sloan Innovation Period (SIP)](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/student-blogs/mfin-2015/sloan-innovation-period-sip/) requirements and will be completed in pairs. You must select your plan by the end of Week 2, and complete the assignment by the end of Week 11. The aim is to distill your experience and insights to tell a story about your project in a compelling way that gets you, and others, excited. Within each team, select one visual option and one written option.

### Visual

*   Photo journal with detailed captions (12 photographs, each with an extensive caption)
*   Video that presents the project, the solution, the host, and the setting

### Written

*   Blog journal of 5–7 posts that tell a story over the course of your project
*   Standalone management module that takes something you did and presents it to a general audience (e.g., a how to guide; or a checklist with detailed explanations)
*   Initial draft of a case

To learn about the motivations behind the Sloan portfolio, refer to Dr. Sastry's insights regarding [Post-trip Work]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/instructor-insights/post-trip-work).
